Ok, i have got the solution. Here I am sharing if someone need sometimes:

Copy the .pem file to ~/.ssh
Create a config file at ~/.ssh

touch ~/.ssh/config

open the config file in nano or vim. nano ~/.ssh/config

Add the following line to config file

Host host_name

HostName ec2.server.address.com

User ec2-user

IdentityFile "~/.ssh/ec2.pem"

Now connect from terminal: ssh host_name
